    DXC Angular Components is a library made for Angular 13 applications. In order
    to use it, you need to include it in an existing Angular project.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are creating a Angular application from scratch, we recommend to
    follow the next steps to install from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    DXC Angular Components is distributed as an npm package. To use it in an
    existing project:

  <p>
    It has defined a peerDependencies in the package.json. As you know, this
    section of depedencies are not installed automatically by npm. System will
    warn you if you run npm install and it does not find this dependency.
  </p>
  <p>
    The versions must be compatible, so if a peerDependency is listed as 2.x,
    you canâ€™t install 1.x . It all follows semantic versioning. Angular can use
    TypeScript path mapping for peer dependencies. How

  <dxc-heading

    weight="normal"
    text="Dxc Halstack Style"
    [margin]="headingMargin"
  ></dxc-heading>

  <p>
    The cdk uses a Dxc Halstack styling so if it's not added, the components
    will not work as expected.
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, it is mandatory to add in your angular.json the library assets
    as well as the theme from Halstack Angular:
  </p>
  <app-code-playground [code]="assetsCode" type="CONSOLE">
  </app-code-playground>
  <p>
    Some components make use of some material styling so its is neccessary to add this line to style.scss:
  </p>
  <app-code-playground [code]="materialThemeCode" type="CONSOLE">
  </app-code-playground>
  <p>
    Lastly, it is also needed our ThemeModule in your app so our default theme
    can be applied with the theme directive. For more information, please go to
    <i>Custom Themes</i> tab.
