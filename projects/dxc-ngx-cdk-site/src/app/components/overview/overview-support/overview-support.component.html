        You are welcome to open an issue there at any time, but before doing
        it, please consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Somebody else migh have already created an issue regarding your
        question or feature request. Please use the search functionality and
        <b>avoid the creation of duplicated issues</b>. In case you want to
        provide your input or express your interest in a feature request,
        please do it in the existing issue.
      </li>
      <li>
        These components are built with the intention of helping developers
        with the most common use cases. But at the same time, we want to
        keep their APIs as simple and intuitive as possible. If you notice a
        missing feature, the team is always happy to discuss about it. But
        please have in mind that we might decide to give it a
        <b>lower priority</b> than what you could expect, or
        <b>even reject</b> it for the sake of API simplicity.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case you need a <b>missing feature</b>, or modify a component in
        any way, you can always <b>fork</b> the repository or copy a
        component to your application and take it up on your own. If you
        think this modification would be useful as part of the library, we
        gratefully accept contributions via pull request (see next section)
      </li>
    </ul>
